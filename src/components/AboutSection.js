          Hi, I'm Hugo.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm a Computer Sorceneer, that's right, I'm an Engineer and a Sorcerer, do you want to know how could this be? I'll describe my typical workday so you can understand, it starts with me <a href='http://www.commitstrip.com/en/2017/01/26/on-the-wrong-track/' target='_blank'> picking the right soundtrack</a> for the arduous task that I'll face ahead, then I use my engineering skills to understand the domain of some tricky problem, when the research is complete it's time to conjure extremely powerful digital sorceries in order to send it to oblivion, that's it. Cool right? I know.
        </p>

          I'm the sportist type, what?! Did you never saw a Sorcerer that like physical activities? Hmm... nice to meet you! Joking apart, I like to play football with my friends and I practice <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muay_Thai' target='_blank'>Muay Thai</a> to keep myself healthy and also to self-defense.
        </p>
        <p>
          I love things that makes me think about life somehow, I usually find this kind of content when I <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfRmbxL5HXk' target='_blank'>play games</a>, read manga, <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MPuoOj5TIw' target='_blank'>listen to music</a>, watch movies or anime, and talk to people with life baggage.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is me, now, if you want to work together? Need some help or guidance? Or simply want to talk about life, the universe and everything else, don't be shy, send me an e-mail or reach me through my social media, I'll be there, I promise.
